The goal is to gap-fill missing daily meteorological data from the nearest met station. Use sev.lter query function to obtain daily data for all met stations from 1988 to 2015-9-30 (http://tierra.unm.edu/search/climate/search.php). This was done station by station, then combined into a single data file called met_all_excel.xlsx. The date data was divided into columns for month, day, year using excel function TextToColumns and delimiting by period. Met_all_excel has 10 met stations. Save the main data sheet as Met_all_excel.csv for use with the R file Met_gap_fill.R. For a given station, match it to another station using pair_location choices for three stations in sequence starting with the closest.  For those stations that have compatible stations past the nearest (pair2, pair3, pair4 in the table previously), use those alternative stations to gap-fill more of precipitation such that later summaries will be as little-skewed as possible. There were 4 dates (2013-12-30, 2013-12-31, 2014-12-30, 2014-12-31) where no precip data were recorded for all stations. Assume zeros for these dates. Call the new table Met_all.csv.
