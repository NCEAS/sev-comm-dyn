The goal is to gap-fill missing daily meteorological data from the nearest met station. Use sev.lter query function to obtain daily data for all met stations from 1988 to present (http://tierra.unm.edu/search/climate/search.php). Data from each station was combined into a single data file called met_all_excel.xlsx. The date column was divided into columns for month, day, year using excel function TextToColumns and delimiting by “/.” Met_all_excel contains the data from all 10 met stations, it was resaved as Met_all_excel.csv for use in R. Each station was matched to three other stations determined by physical proximity (pair1, pair2, pair3). These stations were used in sequence to gapfill precipitation values for dates when data was not acquired. There were 4 dates (12/30/13, 12/31/13, 12/30/14, 12/31/14) where no precipitation data were recorded for all stations. Assume zeros for these dates. The new table was called Met_all.csv and this table is used in later data packets to generate Figure 1.
