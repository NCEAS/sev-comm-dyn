Sevilleta LTER data-sets 182 and 129 (http://sev.lternet.edu/data/sev-182, -129) and R code veg_analysis.r were used to calculate standing biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) for the Creosote and Black Grama core sites. Gap-filled meteorological data from station 49 detailed in data packet 1 was used to plot precipitation in relationship to these plant productivity metrics. Long-term small mammal trapping data from 1989 to present, (http://sev.lternet.edu/data/sev-8) was utilized to plot temporal variation in the small mammal community in both creosote and black grama core sites. The program veg_analysis.r utilizes all of this data to generate a multi-panel figure illustrating precipitation, standing biomass, seasonal net primary productivity, and small mammal population trends for each site. In addition, we used ordination and community dynamic metrics (CoDyn in R) to show temporal differences in community composition of the small mammal data in each of the core sites (sev_rodent_com_analysis.r).
