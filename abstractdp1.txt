This file contains daily meteorological data collected from a network of 10 permanent weather stations on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Multiple csv files were downloaded from the Sevilleta LTER data-portal (http://tierra.unm.edu/search/climate/search.php) and joined together in excel. Any missing data cells were gap-filled from the nearest meteorological station using Met_gap_fill.r. These data were sub-set for station 49, the station closest to our study site.
