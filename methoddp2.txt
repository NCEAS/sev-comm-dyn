The original plant list compiled from Thomas Manthey's master’s thesis (Manthey, G. Thomas 1977, A Floristic Analysis of the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and the Ladrone Mountains) was downloaded from the Sevilleta data portal (http://sev.lternet.edu/data/sev-51). The following archived changes are made continuously to this data set:
* Species are added – this list is augmented by Sevilleta scientists as needed.
* Some taxa have been renamed – Older names for certain taxa are updated to reflect agreement with the botanical community all changes are tracked in the Metadata.
* Plants have been removed from the list – the original thesis covered both the Sevilleta National Wildlife refuge and the Ladron Mountains, all species known to occur only in the Ladron Mountains have been removed.  
* The photosynthetic pathway, life-form and life-cycle data were collected from the literature by Troy Maddux in 1989. 
This data was recently updated with additional information on photosynthetic pathway and life-form based on expert opinion from the University of New Mexico. Due to the fact that these updates are not defensible, this updated file has not been made available on the Sevilleta LTER data-portal. For some plant species, you must submit samples for isotopic analysis to be certain of photosynthetic pathway due to the fact that several taxonomic families contain species utilizing a variety of photosynthetic pathways. The updated file was renamed Sevilleta_Species_List.csv.
